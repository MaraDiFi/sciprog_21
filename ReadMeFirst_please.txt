Hello! 

It's Mara Here.

I just wanted to let you know that you might see the practical 2 and 3 pushed at the same time and quite late in timing. 

Actually I wanted to reorganise my repo in folders so I removed what I have pushed previously and upload the codes again.

You probably know how to verify what I am saying, but I thought it was good to let you know..just in case!

Thank you for the module, I am really enjoing it!

Mara
