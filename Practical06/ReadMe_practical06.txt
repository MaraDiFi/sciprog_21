Hello,

please find in this folder the code required for practical 6.

In particular, we have written a program to multiply two matrices.

The code has been divided in two different files:
a) matrix.c, in which there is the main function, 
b) mm.c, in which there is the subfunction. 

The two files are compiled toghether thank to a Makefile directory (find in the folder) which can create the corresponding executable.

All codes where tested in sciprog before submitting in GIT repo and they were working.
