Hello,

in this folder you can find the updated code to calculate the area of the trapezoidal, required in practical04. This time we added a new coding block using an arrey of value setting a function.

The code was tested in sciprog before and it was working.

Please note that it is necessary to use -lm when compiling the program because math library is used.
